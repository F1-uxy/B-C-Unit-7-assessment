 <p>There are many different techniques used to protect your network from external and internal threats. </p>

 <p>The first technique we will use is to setup groups of users. This is useful as in a business there are different levels of power therefore, this needs to be translated onto the network. Each level can have different access controls such as the network administrator would have access to all data on the network and be able to change passwords for the lower levels however, a lower level user could only be able to access their storage space and any other allocated space on the main Network Attached Storage (NAS) as they might not be trusted with the full power that a network administrator has. Splitting users into groups protects against internal attacks and accidental attacks where someone might accidentally change or delete data that they should not be able to access. This protects from lower level users while also giving full access to the higher level users. </p>
 <p>This threat is amplified for high risk sectors such as the financial sector as for this company where lots of money will be sent abroad, someone could send money and request money from people with malicious intent even if they were a lower level employee. These admin controls should be left to the administrators as they can cause harm to others if used incorrectly. Another situation where this is important is if any of the software is damaged from settings being changed, it could take down the whole network and stop people from sending important money to each other. </p>
 <p>Not implementing user groups can breach the CIA triad. This is because if the wrong people have access to personal information this can breach the Confidentiality point of the CIA triad. With user groups you can limit who can access the personal information files to people who are trusted and not to the public domain.  </p>
